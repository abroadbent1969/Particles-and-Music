In this interactive JavaScript 3D Mandelbulb simulation, several dynamic elements contribute to its visual appeal. First this is that I am setting the simulation to the music of In the Hall of the Mountain King by Edvard Grieg

The Audio Reactivity is achieved through the Web Audio API, where an AnalyserNode continuously processes the loaded audio file's frequency data. The average frequency is calculated per frame and then mapped to dynamically adjust the morphAmplitude of each individual point, causing the fractal's intricate structure to pulse and undulate in sync with the sound. Simultaneously, Global Fractal Movement provides a continuous, subtle drift for the entire Mandelbulb.

This is implemented by incrementing a movementOffset and applying sine and cosine functions to the pointCloud's position.x and position.z properties, creating a smooth, oscillating path around the center of the scene.

Lastly, Color Cycling ensures the fractal's vibrant hues are constantly evolving. A colorCycleOffset is steadily advanced, and in each animation frame, every point's color is re-calculated by shifting its hue based on its original normalizedDistance from the fractal's center and the current colorCycleOffset, ensuring a continuous and smooth transition of colors across the entire structure.
